Creating a Python script that directly pulls local business opportunities from Google would involve using the Google Places API. However, Google Places API requires an API key, which needs to be obtained from the Google Cloud Platform. Due to the sensitive nature of API keys, it's recommended not to include them directly in shared code.

However, I can guide you on how to create a basic framework using Python with the tkinter library for the GUI and show how you might incorporate the Google Places API. Here's an outline:

Firstly, install the googlemaps Python library, which helps interact with the Google Maps API. You can install it via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -U googlemaps
Here is a basic code structure using tkinter for the GUI:

python
Copy code
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox
import googlemaps

def get_businesses():
    city = city_entry.get()
    # Use Google Places API to fetch business data based on the city
    # Use the Google Maps API key here
    
    # For demonstration purposes (without actual API calls)
    # Replace this section with actual API call and data parsing
    messagebox.showinfo("Business Opportunities", f"Fetching businesses in {city}")

# GUI setup
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Local Business Opportunities")

# Label and Entry for City selection
city_label = tk.Label(root, text="Enter City:")
city_label.pack()
city_entry = tk.Entry(root)
city_entry.pack()

# Button to fetch businesses
search_button = tk.Button(root, text="Search", command=get_businesses)
search_button.pack()

root.mainloop()
Remember, to use the Google Places API, you'll need to replace the placeholder in get_businesses() with actual API calls using your API key and then parse the data to display it within the GUI.

Before using the Google Places API, ensure you've reviewed and complied with their usage policies and terms.

Would you like further guidance on how to integrate the Google Places API to fetch business data based on a city?
